\   Garden Control Firmware to manage the Ebb Flow Cycles of the System
\   dp V1.0
\   dp 150511  11:00  replaced all indenting with TABs
\   dp 150516  15:30  update light logic for day night cycles, fixed bug
\                     added logic to retry adc readings 3 times if value (tanklevel) greater than 14
\   dp, ky  151107 15:00 Changed the name of this module and file
\                        to GardenControl.fth
\   dp 160815         modifying code for new DLVR-L30D pressure sensor, Tachyon module and P8 board type
\                     ready for testing, set defaults for new sensor  0.80
\   dp 160824         updated to use DS3232M RTC Ram to save and restore runtime params  0.91
\   dp 160826         cleaned up code and comments, reduced memory allocation to 22 bytes for runtime struct
\   dp 160828         added Peter's techniques,  clean up the code more, ready for live testing again v.93
